**Headers:**

* “Subject” – This is the identifier of the subject that participated in the experiment, of which there are 30 

* “Activity” – This is the activity that each subject performed and for which all of the variables were measured. The activities are standing, sitting, laying, walking, walking_downstairs, and walking_upstairs.

**Variables:**

* "tBodyAcc-mean()-X" – this variable measures the mean of the x-axis accelerometer variable. Measure is bound between -1 and 1.       
* "tBodyAcc-mean()-Y" – this variable measures the mean of the y-axis accelerometer variable. Measure is bound between -1 and 1.           
* "tBodyAcc-mean()-Z" – this variable measures the mean of the z-axis accelerometer variable. Measure is bound between -1 and 1.                     
* "tBodyAcc-std()-X" – this variable measures the standard deviation of the x-axis accelerometer variable. Measure is bound between -1 and 1.                      
* "tBodyAcc-std()-Y" – this variable measures the standard deviation of the y-axis accelerometer variable. Measure is bound between -1 and 1.                                 
* "tBodyAcc-std()-Z" – this variable measures the standard deviation of the z-axis accelerometer variable. Measure is bound between -1 and 1.                                 
* "tGravityAcc-mean()-X" – this variable measures the mean of the x-axis gravity accelerometer variable.        
* "tGravityAcc-mean()-Y" – this variable measures the mean of the y-axis gravity accelerometer variable.          
* "tGravityAcc-mean()-Z" – this variable measures the mean of the z-axis gravity accelerometer variable.
